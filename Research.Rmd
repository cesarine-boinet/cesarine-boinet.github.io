The Development of Inequalities in Child Educational Achievement: A Six Country Study (DICE) is an Open Research Area (ORA)-funded project which aimed to advance our understanding of disparities in child development by parental socioeconomic status. It leveraged rich cohort and administrative data from six countries - France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States – embedding them in a harmonized framework. The project moved beyond cross-sectional and single country snapshots by studying the question of how inequalities develop over time (ages 3 to 16), what factors may influence inequalities and how national context may strengthen or buffer these processes. Child development is conceptualised broadly, to include cognitive, social/emotional and health outcomes, recognizing the interplay of multiple spheres of development in childhood.
