<i> PhD Candidate in Economics – University of Strathclyde, Glasgow </i>
 

<br> <br>
Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD researcher in Economics at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK). My research interests are in the fields of family economics, gender, applied econometrics and empirical microeconomics. My research is funded by the [Institute for Inspiring Children's Futures](https://inspiringchildrensfutures.org/).

<br>
<i> <b> More about me </i> </b>
<br>
I am a French expatriate in Glasgow, here to do my PhD in Economics. My thesis focuses on the role of identity and prescriptions in shaping individuals' behaviours. I am particularly interested in the consequences of such identity and prescriptions on gender inequalities on the labour market, parental investments in their child(ren)'s skills and, in turn, children's outcomes and development.


Before starting my PhD in July 2021, I previously worked as a Data Manager, within the French Institute for Demographic Studies [Ined](https://www.ined.fr/), on the [DICE project](https://dice.site.ined.fr) in Paris (France).

Working on this project reinforced my will to do research, especially on parental investments and how they might be socially graded and gendered. My PhD proposal is entitled "Socioeconomic and gendered differences in early parental investments".
