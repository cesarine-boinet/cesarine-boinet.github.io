<i> Ph.D. Candidate in Economics – University of Strathclyde, Glasgow (UK) & Economist – France Stratégie </i>



<br> <br>
Welcome to my webpage! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK) and an Economist for the French Prime Minister's Office, [France Stratégie](https://www.strategie.gouv.fr/).  My research interests are in the fields of family economics, gender, applied econometrics and empirical microeconomics. My PhD research was funded by the [Institute for Inspiring Children's Futures](https://inspiringchildrensfutures.org/).

<br>
<i> <b> More about me </i> </b>
<br>

As an applied economist, my thesis' work focuses on exploring the impact of societal expectations and norms (e.g., gender norms) on individuals' behaviors. I investigate how these factors contribute to gender inequalities in the labor market around motherhood, and influence parental investments in their child’s skills. As a research fellow at Sciences Po in Paris, I further worked on assessing the effects of a French reform in child allowances, initiated on July 1st, 2015, further focusing on its unintended impact on families and children.


Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey in July 2021, I worked as a Data Manager, within the French Institute for Demographic Studies ([Ined](https://www.ined.fr/)), on the [DICE project](https://dice.site.ined.fr) in Paris (France). My experience with the DICE project solidified my passion for research, especially in the realm of parental investments and their social and gender-related implications.


Please get in touch if you have any question about my research!
