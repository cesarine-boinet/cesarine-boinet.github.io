Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD researcher in Economics at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK). My research interests are in the fields of family economics, gender, applied econometrics and empirical microeconomics. My research is funded by the [Institute for Inspiring Children's Futures](https://inspiringchildrensfutures.org/).


*More about me*:
<br> <br>
I am a French expatriate in Glasgow, here to do my PhD in Economics. Before starting my PhD in July 2021, I previously worked as a Data Manager, within the French Institute for Demographic Studies [Ined](https://www.ined.fr/), on the [DICE project](https://dice.site.ined.fr) in Paris (France).
<br> <br>
The Development of Inequalities in Child Educational Achievement: A Six Country Study (DICE) is an Open Research Area (ORA)-funded project which aimed to advance our understanding of disparities in child development by parental socioeconomic status. It leveraged rich cohort and administrative data from six countries - France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States – embedding them in a harmonized framework. The project moved beyond cross-sectional and single country snapshots by studying the question of how inequalities develop over time (ages 3 to 16), what factors may influence inequalities and how national context may strengthen or buffer these processes. Child development is conceptualised broadly, to include cognitive, social/emotional and health outcomes, recognizing the interplay of multiple spheres of development in childhood.
<br> <br>
 Working on this project reinforced my will to do research, especially on parental investments and how they might be socially graded and gendered. My PhD proposal is entitled "Socioeconomic and gendered differences in early parental investments".
