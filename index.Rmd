<i> PhD Candidate in Economics – University of Strathclyde, Glasgow </i>
 

<br> <br>
Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD researcher in Economics at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK). My research interests are in the fields of family economics, gender, applied econometrics and empirical microeconomics. My research is funded by the [Institute for Inspiring Children's Futures](https://inspiringchildrensfutures.org/).

<i> <b> More about me </i> </b>
<br>


My research focuses on exploring the impact of identity and societal expectations on individuals' behaviours. I am particularly investigating how these factors contribute to gender inequalities in the labour market and influence parental investments in their children's skills, subsequently affecting children's outcomes and development.

Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey in July 2021, I worked as a Data Manager, within the French Institute for Demographic Studies ([Ined](https://www.ined.fr/)), on the [DICE project](https://dice.site.ined.fr) in Paris (France).

My experience with the DICE project solidified my passion for research, especially in the realm of parental investments and their social and gender-related implications. The title of my Ph.D. proposal is "Socioeconomic and Gendered Differences in Early Parental Investments."

Please get in touch if you have any question about my research!
