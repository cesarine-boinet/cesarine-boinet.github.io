<br> <br>
Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK) and a Visiting Research Fellow at Sciences Po (Paris, FR).  My research interests are in the fields of family economics, gender, applied econometrics and empirical microeconomics. My research is funded by the [Institute for Inspiring Children's Futures](https://inspiringchildrensfutures.org/).

<i> <b> More about me </i> </b>
<br>


My research focuses on exploring the impact of identity and societal expectations on individuals’ behaviours. I am particularly investigating how these factors contribute to gender inequalities in the labour market, and influence parental investments in their children’s skills – subsequently affecting children’s outcomes and development.

I am currently working – as a research fellow – on assessing the effects of a French reform in child allowances, initiated on July 1st, 2015, further focusing on its unintended impact on child deprivation.


Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey in July 2021, I worked as a Data Manager, within the French Institute for Demographic Studies ([Ined](https://www.ined.fr/)), on the [DICE project](https://dice.site.ined.fr) in Paris (France).

My experience with the DICE project solidified my passion for research, especially in the realm of parental investments and their social and gender-related implications. The title of my Ph.D. proposal is "Socioeconomic and Gendered Differences in Early Parental Investments."

Please get in touch if you have any question about my research!
